      <p>
        Welcome! This portal provides guidance for adults who want to support
        children on their financial literacy journey. Use the resources
        below to reinforce what your learners experience in the Sim Lab and
        connect those lessons to everyday life.

    <div class="container">
      <h4>How to Get Involved</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Discuss budgeting together:</strong> Start by using the
          Budgeting Game to plan a monthly budget. Ask your child to think
          about needs versus wants and to set savings goals. Encourage them
          to reflect on their choices and how it feels to save for the
          future.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Explore investing and risk:</strong> Join your learner in the
          Stock and Real Estate simulations. Talk about how stock prices
          fluctuate and how owning property can build long‑term wealth. Discuss
          the importance of diversification and not putting all your money in
          one place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plan for college and careers:</strong> Use the College &amp;
          Career Planner to compare tuition costs, scholarships, loans and
          career salaries. This exercise helps demystify the process of
          paying for higher education and weighing different career paths.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch lessons and complete quizzes:</strong> Watch the video
          lessons together and discuss key takeaways. The quizzes that follow
          each video reinforce comprehension and allow you to celebrate
          progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Offer encouragement:</strong> Positive affirmations can boost
          confidence. Celebrate badges and XP milestones and remind young
          learners that mistakes are part of the learning process.

      <h4>Curriculum Alignment</h4>
      <p>
        The activities on Little Leader align with nationally recognised
        financial literacy standards, including earning income, spending,
        saving, investing, managing credit and managing risk【539083898243570†L386-L432】.
        They also incorporate mathematics concepts such as ratios,
        percentages and data analysis that are foundational in the Common
        Core State Standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our science and engineering explorations connect finance to
        systems thinking and data modelling. This three‑dimensional
        learning reflects the Next Generation Science Standards’ emphasis on
        crosscutting concepts, scientific practices and core ideas【13214476530571†L100-L147】.
