      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Little Leader’s mission is to empower African American children and families with the knowledge,
        skills and confidence to navigate their financial futures. Through culturally relevant games,
        simulations, lessons and collaborative activities aligned with Common Core and NGSS standards,
        we aim to make personal finance and STEM concepts accessible and engaging from kindergarten
        through high school. We partner with parents and educators to nurture curiosity, critical
        thinking and responsible decision‑making so every child can imagine, plan and achieve their
        boldest dreams.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        We envision a generation of young leaders who see themselves as capable innovators and
        financial stewards. By providing real‑world experiences—managing budgets, investing,
        preparing for college and careers—in a supportive and joyful environment, Little Leader
        strives to close educational gaps and build enduring economic equity. Our long‑term goal is
        to inspire students to become confident problem‑solvers and compassionate community members
        who use their skills to uplift themselves and others.
